My website where I try stuff!

Still a big WIP... And should forever be!

Switched to [Svelte]/[Sapper] with some [Tailwind CSS]. It's not perfect yet, but I included a copy of my VS Code settings

[Svelte]: <https://svelte.dev/>
[Sapper]: <https://sapper.svelte.dev/>
[Tailwind CSS]: <https://tailwindcss.com/>
